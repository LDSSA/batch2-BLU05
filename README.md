# BLU05 - Data sources and formats

## What is in this BLU? 
This is the second BLU in the Data Wrangling specialization. In this specialization you'll learn how to get data from multiple data sources and how to transform raw data into clean enough data so that you can begin your data science workflow.

In this BLU, we'll learn about three new data sources.
The first one are SQL databases. In this context, we'll learn some basics about databases and how to do queries using the Structured Query Language.
The second one are public APIs, and here we'll learn how to do HTTP GET requests.
The last one are web pages, and we'll learn a technique to retrieve content from the Web called web scraping.

This will be a funny one :)
